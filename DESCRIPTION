Description: Allows to perform the dynamic mixture estimation with state-space components and normal regression components, and clustering with normal mixture. Quasi-Bayesian estimation, as well as, that based on the Kerridge inaccuracy approximation are implemented. Main references: Nagy and Suzdaleva (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.apm.2013.05.038>; Nagy et al.
